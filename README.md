## 💻 Code Summary

<details><summary>Root</summary>

| File | Summary |
| ---- | ------- |
| power_of_number.py |  The code defines a function called `power_with_user_input` that prompts the user to enter a base number and an exponent, then calculates and prints the result of raising the base number to the power of the exponent using a recursive function called `power`. |
| unit_test.py |  The code defines a test case class for testing power functions, with three test cases: positive exponents, negative exponents, and zero exponents. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

 To get started with this project, follow these steps:<br>
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Run the unit tests to ensure that everything is working correctly: `python unit_test.py`
3. If the unit tests pass, you can run the script to see the power of numbers: `python power_of_number.py`

That's it! You should now be able to use the script to calculate the power of numbers.
